	description: "Fungi is all around us: the air, water and earth are all packed full of it. Did you know that fungi is essential to our bodily functions and to many natural processes such as decay of debris in woodland? Some people even call networks of fungi “the earth's internet”. This activity allows participants a view into the myceilial world, utilising multimedia to tell the story mushrooms. As well as being a physcial, practical activity where we impregnate small logs with mycelium which participants are welcome to take home to remind them of their learning experience.",

	description: "Micro greens are the young sprouts and shoots of our favrourite edible plants. Did you know micro-greens contain by-weight up to 40 times the nutritional content of the same fully-grown plants? Many micro-greens contain essential and highly beneficial vitamins and minerals that are difficult to find in shop bought produce (that has been sitting on the shelves for a few days before we get to it!). Yet we can buy oodles of microgreens seeds in any supermarket for next to nothing! This activity equips you with everything you need to know to get started growing the cheapest and healthiest veg on the planet.",

	name: "The Incredible World of Bokashi", 
	description: "Bokashi solves many of the problems of composting by turning it into a much shorter and simpler process and one that can happen almost entirely, odor-free, in your kitchen at home. Adapted from Korean natural farming techniques we look in detail at the beneficial micro-organisms that allow Bokashi to turbo-charge the transformation of food-waste into black gold! We also look at other Korean natural farming techniques to see how they may be applied in our gardens and at home.",

	name: "Olla! Olla!", 
	description: "Olla (pronounced Oi-ah) pots are an ancient method of watering plants. By burying porous clay pots in the earth with crops, ollas slowly release just the right amount of water to the rootzone of the plants, thereby dramatically reducing the water loss through evaporation associated with watering the ground. Used in China and Africa for thousands of years, this activity get participants thinking about the value of water on earth and how we might best go about using this resource sustainably as well as displaying the incredible ingenuity and wisdom of past and present agricultural societies that our fast-paced civilization has not rembered as perhaps it should. Hands-on pot throwing and firing to produce a beautiful and useful end result!",

	name: "Introduction to Foraging", 
	description: "Foraging has seen a much deserved uptick in interest in recent years and rightly so because our woodlands, fields, suburbs and beaches are jammed full of superfoods, spices and delicacies just waiting to be picked, nibbled on and preserved by us. This activity will see us roam local landscapes (and some unexpected places) in search of fine tastes and fascinating stories that the plants around us help to tell. For all ages and all weathers, this activity engages us and brings us closer what may be our most familiar but most unknown landscapes.",

	name: "Wasteland Flora", 
	description: "I am from Bradford. Amongst our beautiful natural landscapes and other causes for bragging there are vast tracts of what people might call wasteland. As I've grown up I've stopped seeing these places as a blight on our home or a just opportunity for building houses. I have started to see many beautiful species of plants, insect and animal, busily making a paradise out of nothing whilst we are fretting over whether or not this-or-that building or shopping centre will be built. These collections of organisms are not merely pests and weeds or inferior substitutes for their “better” cousins in field, dale and wood, they are pioneers and genuises and they are just as beautiful. We believe people will see value in these places once they are allowed to know – and to love – them.",
